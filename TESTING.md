### Testing User Stories from User Experience Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about what it offers.

     <!-- 1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
     2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
     3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation. -->

  2. To see a large portion of the content without registering.

     <!-- 1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
     2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
     3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is. -->

  3. To be able to search for swimming sets using appropriate keywords.

     <!-- 1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
     2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
     3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them. -->

  4. A convenient registration process.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1.  A convenient login and logout process.

  2.  To be able to search for swimming sets using appropriate keywords.

  3.  To have access to a personal profile.

  4.  To be able to save 'favourite' swimming sets created by other users under my profile.

  5.  To be able to add new swimming sets.

  6.  To be able to edit or delete swimming sets from my profile.

- #### As the site owner/admin, I want...

  1. To manage categories (add, edit or delete).

  2. To be able to edit or remove content submitted by users.
